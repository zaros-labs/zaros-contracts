Cases to consider:
These are same as the perp market id does/not exist
given the price adapter is not defined  
  it should revert // PriceAdapterNotDefined
given the price adapter is defined 

Some cases to explore: 
when the size delta is less than the min trade size?
given the account won't meet the margin requirements
given there is no pending market order

* some cases may be not in the function logic, but still could make sense to be there
